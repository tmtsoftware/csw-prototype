# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added [BlockingConfigManager](src/main/scala/csw/services/cs/core/BlockingConfigManager.scala) 
  (a blocking API to the Config Service)

- Added [PrefixedActorLogging](src/main/scala/csw/services/log/PrefixedActorLogging.scala) to use in place
  of ActorLogging, to include a component's subsystem and prefix in log messages (subsystem is part of a component's prefix)
  
- Added [HcdControllerClient](src/main/scala/csw/services/ccs/HcdControllerClient.scala) 
  and [AssemblyControllerClient](src/main/scala/csw/services/ccs/AssemblyControllerClient.scala) classes, as
  an alternative API that makes clear which methods can be call (or which messages can be sent to the actor)
  
- Add `get(path, date)` method to [ConfigManager](src/main/scala/csw/services/cs/core/ConfigManager.scala) and
  all Config Service APIs, so that you can get the version of a file for a given date

- Added new [Alarm Service](alarms) and [command line app](apps/asConsole).
  An Alarm Service [Java API](javacsw/README.alarms.md) is also available.

- Added a *Request* message to [AssemblyController](ccs/src/main/scala/csw/services/ccs/AssemblyController.scala) that
does something based on the contents of the configuration argument and returns a status and optional value (also a SetupConfig).
The main difference between Request and Submit is that Request can return a value, while Submit only returns a status.

- Added Java APIs for most services (See the [javacsw](javacsw) and  [util](util) subprojects)

### Changed
- Renamed the earlier Hornetq based `event` project to [event_old](event_old) 
  and renamed the Redis based `kvs` project to [events](events). 
  Classes with *KeyValueStore* in the name have been renamed to use *EventService*. 

- Renamed Config Service Java interfaces to start with I instead of J, to be more like the other Java APIs

- Reimplemented parts of the configuration classes, adding Scala and Java DSLs (See [util](util))

- Changed most log messages to debug level, rather than info

- Reimplemented the configuration classes, adding type-safe APIs for Scala and Java, JSON I/O, serialization (See [util](util))

- Changes the install.sh script to generate Scala and Java docs in the ../install/doc/{java,scala} directories

- Changed the [Configuration Service](cs) to use svn internally by default instead of git. In the svn implementation there
  is only one repository, rather than a local and a main repository..

- Reimplemented the [Command and Control Service](ccs) and [component packaging](pkg) classes:
  New HcdController, AssemblyController traits.
  No longer using the Redis based StateVariableStore to post state changes:
  The new version inherits a PublisherActor trait. You can subscribe to state/status messages from HCDs and
  assemblies.

- Changed the design of the [Location Service](loc) APIs.
