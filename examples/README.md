Examples
===========

This directory contains some example code:

* [assemblyExample](assemblyExample) - a simple example assembly that sends messages to the example HCD
* [hcdExample](hcdExample) - a simple example HCD that generates position events along with an event subscriber that logs them

For a detailed, end to end, "Vertical Slice" example that demonstrates how to develop and test Assemblies and HCDs in Scala and Java, 
see the [csw-vslice-example](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw-vslice-example) project.

See [here](https://github.com/tmtsoftware/csw/releases/download/v0.3-PDR/TMTCommonSoftwareProgramming-CSWFD_REL01_KG.pdf)
for a detailed description of the CSW software, including sections about the vertical slice examples.
